                  <em>Responsive, Intuitive Interfaces with Ruby</em>
                  The next step in the evolution of user interfaces is here.
                  Chatbots let your users interact with your service in their
                  own natural language. Use free and open source tools along
                  with Ruby to build creative, useful, and unexpected interactions
                  for users. Take advantage of the Lita frameworkâ€™s step-by-step
                  implementation strategy to simplify bot development and testing.
                  From novices to experts, chatbots are an area in which everyone
                  can participate. Exercise your creativity by creating chatbot
                  skills for communicating, information, and fun.
